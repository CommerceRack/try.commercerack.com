		<h2 id="wowSummary">CommerceRack: Executive Summary</h2>
		<p class="indented">CommerceRack is a cloud service that can facilitate both mobile and browser experiences for both customers in store and at home, while also sending inventory to marketplaces like eBay, and Amazon.
		CommerceRack service facilitates all types of transactional commerce on a cloud infrastructure.
		</p>
	
		<div class="alignCenter"><img src="img/howitworks.jpg" /></div>
	
		<h4>High level functionality:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li> use /app based/ websites, with a shopping cart, and accept orders</li>
		<li> automatically connect with marketplaces like with amazon, ebay, rakutan, newegg, sears and others.</li>
		<li> host product catalog, inventory, and supply chain in the cloud </li>
		<li> access order management, shipping, tracking, crm/wholesale, and warehouse data from any device.</li>
		<li> compatible with existing infrastructure, including existing websites.</li>
		</ul>

		<div>
		<h4>Key Differentiators:</h4>
		<ul>
		<li> 
		Browser/Native Apps create additional conversion opportunities compare to traditional websites. 
		<span data-trivia="more">
		Mobile devices have new capabilities such as the ability to access voice processing, location (gps), and push messaging. 
		Social is an untapped frontier of clients who just need the right reasons to share.
		Browser apps are better suited for the complex client side logic of todays multi-display, multi-device, multi-operating system world. 
		</li>
		<li> 
		MarketPlace Optimization (MpO) improves sales velocity on Amazon, eBay, and others.  
		<span data-trivia="more">
		A majority of growth in online sales has been on marketplaces such as Amazon.
		Online Marketplaces choose which sellers will be recommended in the "Buy Box" using ranking algorithms.
		Both <acronym title="MarketPlace Optimization">MpO</acronym>
		and <acronym title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</acronym> are very similar because both deal with the study of ranking
		algorithms based on signals.  Search engines use signals like page content, meta tags and links as signals to determine
		which page to recommend.  Marketplaces use signals like price, inventory level, geographic local, order cancellation rate and others to determine which seller to recommend for the Buy Box.  
		It's serious business - the seller who receives the buy box for an item will receive approximately 97% of the total sales velocity for that item! CommerceRack is the platform for people who are serious about MpO. 
		</span>
		</li>
		<li> 
		Built for the cloud.
		<span data-trivia="more"> The Cloud uses massive economies of scale to deliver business friendly services including dramatic cost savings and unparalleled functionality. Cloud software has all the advantages of <acronym title="software as a service">SAAS</acronym> but also gives a higher degree of flexibility and operator independence.
		In fact a majority of the estimated $80 billion dollars that will be spent on cloud services by the year 2016 will come from SMB's between 25 and 200 employees.

	<h4>Apps Are The Future</h4>
	<p>
	With anyCommerce's app-based commerce framework, shopping experiences can be custom tailored to fit business needs. 
	As businesses grows and needs change, the store can easily change right along with it.
	Apps use github to support iterative updates, allowing you more flexibility as a business grows.
	</p>
	<aside data-trivia="demo">
	Here are some app based sites:
	<ul>
	<li> <a href="http://app.sportsworldchicago.com">http://app.sportsworldchicago.com</a></li>
	</ul>
	<i>Look at the "see it in action" section for more</i>

	</span>
	<span class="apps_provide">
	<h4>Apps: The Future Of Online Shopping</h4>
	<ul>
	<li>
		Apps delivers enhanced user experience for customers.
		<span data-trivia="more">
		Browser based apps are faster and can easily utilize animations, timers, and videos while content is being loaded.
		Native apps can do all that and access push messaging, cameras, gps, on device wallets, and device identity management.
		</span>
		<aside data-trivia="dev">
		websites are limited by both the web-server and browser, whereas apps are restricted only to what is possible in HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript.  
	
		Additionally apps are stateful, they never need to reload (except during an http/https transition).
		Normally during a page reload the browser experiences a small loss of communication with the server, this also
		causes any animation loops, event timers, videos, etc. to be reset, or at least serialized/deserialized and reinstantiated which causes both unnecessary complexity and delay.
		</aside>
	</li>
	<li>
		Apps have lower operating costs. 
		<span data-trivia="more">
		A normal app will have anywhere from 50% to 90% savings per page in infrastructure costs over a server generated website.
		</span>
		<aside data-trivia="dev">
		Apps are generally static which are better in every measurable aspect than traditional sites (faster, cheaper, easier, and more scalable to serve than any dynamic page).
		commercerack instances are configured for hot-object caching using memcache, and redis, and make effective use of fast ephemeral
		disks rather than writing to network block storage.
		internal communication between modules is done using uwsgi over named pipes, and signals taking full advantage of shared memory. 
		techniques like auto-image rescaling reduce bandwidth, and pre-compressing and minimizing files and storing them in memory
		takes a machete to both processor utilization and latency due to compression.
		Additionally in many private cloud configurations SSL accelerators can be added to further offload core processors (note: many
		CDN's do this as well)
		With apps content is only transferred once, and cached locally, compared to even a very optimized webpage the same headers, footers, etc. must be re-transmitted each time. 
		This is also more efficient than AJAX because multiple requests are automatically pipelined into a single HTTP/HTTPS connection, or 
		sent over an already established messaging channel between app and instance via a websocket.
		</aside>
	</li>
	<li>
		Apps let developers work faster. <span data-trivia="more">apps take weeks, equivalent websites take months.</span>
		<aside data-trivia="dev">
		App developer IS faster because apps can be developed and tested locally, and will typically use git code manage to track revisions and changes.
		websites have more moving parts (ex: server plugins, etc.) and testing and debugging those can add a significantly amount of 
		unknown time to projects. 
		features like branching and forking in git make it easy to do iterative development and test locally. 
		</aside>
	</li>
	<li>
		Apps are more secure. <span data-trivia="more">
		Apps run locally so many of the normal exploits that would come from installing a poorly written module are non-existent.
		The most common types of attacks against webservers will actually target the attackers own computer where the app is running.
		</span>
		<aside data-trivia="dev">
		Apps run locally so probes, xss attacks, etc. all happen to the attackers own computer.
		
		Apps are static and can be physically hosted in virtually any environment, they can also
		pull content from other applications or webapi's using mashups (cloud api calls that return json prettified content)

		A single api has reduced attack vectors, and a clean parameter handling using json encoding.
		The commerceRack intent based api can track calls by sessions and types of calls, and/or ip address, and/or netblock in an effort to detect bots.  Once a bot is detected it can be treated specially (for example never be allowed to login,
		and given false pricing ex: a competitor's intelligence bot)
		Normal DDOS attacks will generally target a domain, which can be a CDN or other reasonably hardened target.
		Effective use of hot-object cache means cloud infrastructures can be quickly and easily scaled out to handle even well equipped attackers.

	<h2 id="wowMarketplaces">Marketplace Integration</h2>
	<div class="clear"></div>

	<p>Today many consumers who shop online will only do so at websites like Amazon.com. 
	In order to reach those clients businesses have two choices: 1. Buy a storefront from Amazon, 
	2. find a third party solution for processing Amazon sales.  
	CommerceRack is better than Amazon's webstores because we include numerous Marketplace Optimization features, in addition to support for marketplace logistics services like Fulfilment by Amazon. 
	</p>
	
	<article data-trivia="more">
	<h3>Amazon Webstores vs. CommerceRack</h3>
	Amazon offers it's own limited store fronts, they are significantly more expensive and also lack features 
	which would allow a company to differentiate itself from peers.  
	In addition Amazon's fees are substantially higher than CommerceRack, and they lack many features that CommerceRack has 
	(such as non-Amazon warehouse capabilities).

	<h3>Why is MpO important?</h3>
	<p>It's no secret customers are shopping less on search engines and more on marketplaces. 
	<acronym title="MarketPlace Optimization">MpO</acronym> is the science behind winning the coveted "Buy Box" on marketplaces like Amazon. With Search Engine Optimization (<acronym title="Search Engine Optimization">SEO</acronym>) a company would 
	focus on providing good signals like meta tags, links, and content that would be used to determine rank.
	MpO uses signals like inventory level, price, and order cancellation rate.

	<h3>Example Ranking Signals</h3>
	<p>Below is a sample of the signals a marketplace could use to rank sellers: </p>
	<ul>
		<li>Total Cost to Buyer (including shipping)</li>
		<li>Overall Order Cancellation Rate of the Seller</li>
		<li>Shipping Latency</li>
		<li>History and Experience of the Seller on the Marketplace</li>
		<li>Overall Customer Feedback</li>
		<li>Available Inventory for Purchase</li>
		<li>Order Defect Rate as a % of Gross Sales</li>
		<li>Late Shipments as a % of Total Shipments</li>
		<li>Gross Sales</li>
		<li>Total # of Sales on Marketplace</li>

	<h2 id="wowAwesome">Why you should use CommerceRack</h2>			

	<div>
	<h3>Cloud &gt; SAAS</h2>
	<p> Many people confuse Cloud and SAAS, but they are not the same.
	<span data-trivia="more">
	SAAS offers limited infrastructure/deployment options, whereas in Cloud the infrastructure and software 
	are independent. 
	</span>
	Our App and Cloud deployment model avoids <acronym
	title="technical debt (also called design debt or code debt) is a term used to refer to technology decisions which short near term costs, and expensive long term costs">technical debt</acronym> that plagues other e-Commerce offerings, 
	especially those operated as SAAS.
	<span onClick="showTrivia('more',  $(this).parent(), $(this));" class="inlineBlock showTrivia showTriviaBtnWideMore" ></span>
										
	<article data-trivia="more">
	In 1998 when Software as a service (SAAS) arrived it challenged conventional "purchased" software model and took the software 
	industry by storm. 
	Since then SAAS has historically provided an inexpensive use-as-necessary approach for deploying software, but SAAS also has pain points including:
	<ul>
		<li> Lock-in/Data-silos: can be difficult to get data in/out of systems.</li>
		<li> Forced upgrades: new versions may disrupt business. 
		<span data-trivia="more"> 
		Upgrades may introduce bugs, or change the behavior of required features at less than ideal times.
		</span>
		</li>
		<li> Loss of Control: Subscriber is 100% dependent on SAAS provider for updates to platform.</li>
		<li data-trivia="more -d 0"><span data-trivia="more" class="noBG">Not Configurable: Any configuration that is not offered explicitly by a SAAS provider is not possible.</span></li>
		<li data-trivia="more -d 0"><span data-trivia="more" class="noBG">Shared Infrastructures: Most SAAS architectures operate on multi-tenant architectures meaning the actions of one tenant can be disruptive to other clients by consuming excessive resources.</span></li>
		<li data-trivia="more -d 0"><span data-trivia="more" class="noBG">Forced Resource Limits: In order to provide a stable system most SAAS operators will limit the functionality rather than upgrading resources.  In some cases features won't even be added because	they could consume too many resources.</span></li>
		<li data-trivia="more -d 0"><span data-trivia="more" class="noBG">Faith Required: SAAS companies may document their procedures, but there are no audit or third party certifications to verify these.
		Companies based on SAAS don't really know about backup procedures, they must take declarations from a provider on nothing more than faith and reputation.</span>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	Cloud software has all the same benefits as SAAS (rapid deployment, low entry cost, etc.) but none of the downsides. 
	SAAS was the best option for software before The Cloud and Apps.  
Companies that depend on IT for the revenue will discover that The Cloud and Apps has all the same benefits of SAAS but
will typically offer cost savings, AND has none of the disadvantages.

	<h4 class="alignLeft">Unified Engagement</h4>
	<p>
	Delivering the fastest and best customer experience is just part of what we do.
	CommerceRack and anyCommerce can deliver a unified experience to customers - across every point of consumer engagement including in-store, mobile, social, call-center, and existing websites. 
	</p>
	<p data-trivia="more">
	By providing a consumer with more opportunities to shop and purchase on their terms, customers will buy more frequently, and spend more.  
	</p>
	<p data-trivia="more">
	anyCommerce makes it cost effective to roll out a unified experience by using a common core based on HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript, and then
	embedding that into a native shell.   This is especially important as the new mobile operating systems such as Windows Phone,
	ChromeOS, FireFox OS, UnbuntOS, Sailfish and others come online, not to mention new delivery vehicles like X-Box.

	<h4>Ready for Tomorrow</h4>
	<p>
	CommerceRack was built for the looming challenges retailers face. 
	Recently Practical eCommerce listed the top e-commerce challenges for 2014 (<a href="http://www.practicalecommerce.com/articles/62217-5-Ecommerce-Challenges-for-2014">Link</a>) here the list of five items is below.
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li> Offer Free 2-Day Shipping
		<span data-trivia="more">
		Shipping across the country two day is extremely cost prohibitive for virtually all items.  It is much less expensive to stage popular items at geographically warehouses.
		Out of the box CommerceRack supports multiple supplier and intelligent item routing. 
		</span>		
		</li>
		<li> Put Mobile Design and Marketing first
		<span data-trivia="more">Apps deliver a better experience on mobile devices than traditional websites.  CommerceRack also includes the first CRM system to incorporate email AND device Push notifications for customers, as well as the ability to link to facebook, google and others. </span>
		</li>
		<li> More Personalization and Customization.
		<span data-trivia="more">Apps are stateful - they can persistently store and evaluate recent search history to create personalized campaigns.</span>
		</li>
		<li> Use Big data for Big Information
		<span data-trivia="more">The easiest way to use big data is to store that information in the cloud. CommerceRack is the only Commerce Platform build for the cloud.</span>
		</li>
		<li> Sell Seamlessly Across Channels and Devices
		<span data-trivia="more">
		This is sort of our bread and butter.  In the article they especially outline how important a unified experience is especially in todays complicated mixed-device ecosystems.  CommerceRack uses HTML5 for layout inside native device shells make it easy to unify customer experiences.

						<p>
						In the past, one of the biggest challenges in growing a successful online business was choosing the appropriate technology for evolving business needs.  CommerceRack includes so many features to assist growth
						the hardest part is figuring out what to do first (and we offer a service to help with that too!)

						<div class="icon cloud"></div>
						<h2 id="cloud" class="alignRight">anyCommerce Apps</h2>
						<p>
	CommerceRack uses anyCommerce Apps to create one of a kind shopping experiences.  Being app based means our technology is not only better optimized for mobile than traditional websites but it is also far more efficient and scalable because the app uses the customers phone, tablet, or browser to do the majority of the computing. 
	<span data-trivia="more">
	Both native and browser apps run on the customers device requiring far fewer server resources 
	(~90% savings)
	AND improving security thanks to reduced server code footprint, and fewer attack vectors.
	</span>
	
						</p>
						<article data-trivia="more">
						<h3>Why is being App Based better?</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Fewer resources: better handles demand spikes</li>
						<li>Can "go native" and access cameras, location, and more</li>
						<li>More mobile friendly (faster, uses less bandwidth than traditional websites)</li>
						<li> New capabilities such as bi-directional communication to let employees connect the customers shopping cart and provide ordering assistance such as finalizing quotes, making price adjustments, or  administratively altering shipping costs.</li>
	<li> CommerceRack can not only make it easy to give preferred customers special pricing, but it also includes counter intelligence capabilities -- which can detect when a competitor is  scanning your pricing/inventory and silently put them on an alternate price list, just to make their lives a little more difficult. </li>
	<li> Apps are effectively standalone nodes in the cloud -- so most common types of attacks will only target the attackers own computer systems. </li>
		</ul>
Using this new technology questions can be answered much faster making both staff and customers even happier.

						<h2 id="ready" class="alignLeft">Cloud Services</h2>
						<p>
	Cloud infrastructure is estimated to be an $80 billion dollar business by 2016, with a large portion of that growth coming from SMB adoption of companies between 25 and 200 employees.  The reason is simple: 
	The Cloud enables all companies to tap into a vast array of computing power and resources previously unavailable.
	<span data-trivia="more">
	Not only is it possible to do more, but the economies of scale of operating massive data centers drive costs below
	what traditional IT services or SAAS can deliver.
	As a result businesses that fail to follow a Cloud strategy will be at a significant competitive disadvantage. 
	</span>
	
	<div data-trivia="more">
	
	CommerceRack reduces costs by making data like product catalogs, inventory, crm, order and fulfillment, inventory, tracking and returns information available via the cloud.  We can synchronize with marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, directly with web browsers, and mobile devices, and also keep any legacy IT systems or websites in sync as well.
	</div>
						</p>
						<article data-trivia="more">
						<h3>Why is being Cloud Based better?</h3>
						<ul>
						<li>Cloud apps can be run on any device anywhere in the world.</li> 
						<li>Elastic: Server resources can be easily added as they are needed.</li>
						<li>On-Demand: Server resources are only paid for when they are needed/used.</li>
						<li>Reduced IT Resources: Cloud servers are faster to provision and maintain, reducing staffing costs</li>
						<li>Costs Less: Cloud infrastructures utilize huge economies of scale in data centers from companies like Amazon and Google which is impossible for most companies to achieve on their own.</li>
						<li> More Secure: Less susceptible to Denial of Service (DOS) attacks.</li>

						<p>
	CommerceRack has better security than traditional IT or SAAS based services which require plugins.
	</p>
	
	<article data-trivia="more">
	<ul>
	<li> Cloud Extension Pattern: unlike some SAAS/Hosted solutions we don't install plugins, instead the system uses a 
	cloud extension pattern which shares data with systems.  Most companies lack the resources to audit the security of plugins, 
	and most plugins are actually very poorly written (from a security standpoint) since they tend to be open. </li>
	
	<li> Reduced Attack Vectors: this claim is made purely on the fact that a majority of the display/render code runs on
	the client in a Rich Internet Application.  display/render code tends to be written by people with a design heavy, less
	security focused background and is where MOST web-exploits originate. (ex: PHP/Ruby/etc. which are very designer friendly
	and let display code intermingle with app code have abysmal security records).  Bad code cut and pasted by an inexperienced designer (obtained from an online forum) can no longer pose a security threat. 
	forum by </li>
	
	<li> Intent Based API: CommerceRack uses an innovative "Intent Based API" which can model application usage and restrict lower
	privilege operators (such as those in a call center) to specific job roles, and limit the number of records they can access.
	This ensures that any type of security breach such as a lost password from an offshore contractor does not compromise the
	entire companies infrastructure and customer database. If "bad guys" are able to obtain customer records even without credit cards
	they will typically	use those addresses to socially engineer credit cards.</li>

					<h4>What is Marketplace Optimization?</h4>
					<p>Marketplace Optimization is a revolutionary new concept in the ever changing online marketplace. Emerging software and services are used to optimize a company's sales strategy in order to increase seller ranking on multiple marketplaces (Amazon, eBay, etc.).</p>			
					<p>A Marketplace Optimization Expert provides insight into the individual ranking algorithms (signals) used by marketplaces to recommend sellers to prospective buyers. By identifying and improving signal performance a company will receive preference, resulting in increased exposure (sales) on a marketplace by winning the "Buy Box".</p>
					<p>					
					</article>	


	<article data-trivia="more">
	<h4>Comparison: SEO &amp; MpO</h4>
<p>
Marketplace Optimization (MpO) is the future of retail Search Engine Optimization (SEO).
Both SEO and MPO are similar because both evaluate ranking signals, and try to strengthen weak signals to improve result page position.
But SEO and MPO because Marketplaces use an entirely different set of offer/performance signals to rank sellers on their platforms (for example inventory &amp; price, instead of meta tags and content).  Adding better meta tags and content would have zero MpO benefit.
For retail transactions Marketplace signals are much better at helping customers find the products/vendors they are looking for.
</p>
<p>
We anticipate in the future that search engines will be incorporating more marketplace signals to rank websites in search engine results. This is because marketplaces use measurable performance metrics that give an accurate assessment of the
customers overall shopping experience on the marketplace. In the future MpO may be more important to a company than SEO. In October 2011, Google announced its “Trusted Stores” program which will utilize high level marketplace signals from selected retailers that will be used to differentiate websites during the 2011 holiday shopping season.

	<h4>Common MpO Strategies</h4>

	<li> Reduce Order Cancellations</li>

	<h2>Email/Push Campaigns</h2>
	<p>
	The CommerceRack Campaign feature enables businesses to communicate to customers via email and app-push. 
	Once customers have migrated to app-push a business can leverage so many exciting benefits (including guaranteed delivery).
	</p>

	<article data-trivia="more">
	<h3>Times are Changing</h3>
	<p>
	Email is certainly showing it's age. For promotional messages both placement and effectiveness rates are falling thanks to daily blasts from companies like Groupon and LivingSocial. 
	Young adults are using email less and less and replacing it with social networks like Facebook or Twitter which use their own applications with app-push.  CommerceRack includes the first <acronym title="Customer Relations Management">CRM Database</acronym> which allows customers to choose between email, and app-push. Businesses should view this as nothing more than a natural evolution of the historical "text or html email" question that was routinely asked between 1995 and 2005.  If a customer has installed an app we will automatically flag them for app push, and if the native app is uninstalled they can be converted back to email. 
	</p>
	</article>
	
	<article data-trivia="more">
	<h3>SMS vs. App Push</h3>
	<p>
	It is very common for app push to be confused with short message service (SMS). SMS or "Texting" is a receiver pays per message service offered by most cellular services which is limited to around 150 characters per message. 
	App Push is sender pays reliable transport offered by mobile platforms such as Android (<acronym title="Google Cloud Messaging">GCM</acronym>), Apple IOS (<acronym title="Apple Push Notifications">APNS</acronym>), and Amazon Kindle (<acronym title="Amazon Digital Messaging">ADM</acronym>). Unlike SMS which is sent to a telephone number, an App push is sent directly to an application subscriber id that was created when the app was installed.  The size and capabilities of app push vary by operating system, but since messages are actually sent to the receiving application it can include instructions to download any amount of content. 
	SMS can contain multimedia audio or video as attachments only, whereas App Push is only limited by the device and could even contain two way video, audio, location or more. 
	</p>
	</article>
	
	<article data-trivia="more">
	<h3>EMAIL vs. App Push</h3>
	<p>
	There are several well known issues businesses face when communicating with email which demonstrates why app-push could
	eventually replace email. 
	<ul>
	<li> Spam Filters: the original design of email has no way to authenticate legitimacy of senders, so complicated filters effectively "guess" the nature of messages.  With app push the consent is implicit with the install of the application and so
	no such filters exist.</li>
	<li> Email Formatting: email was originally designed for text on dumb terminals, and pre-dates html/web by almost 20 years. 
	due to some early design limitations and incompatibilities it is not possible to use modern html5, css3, and javascript.
	It is generally understood with email it is possible to embed graphics, but it is generally not possible to leverage the
	easier and more powerful features of html5 and css. App-push is not subject to these limitations, it can display both email
	messages and also the enhanced messages.</li>
	<li> List Maintenance: due to incompatibilities in email/smtp clients there is not a reliable way to detect if a message was delivered. <acronym title="Email Service Providers">ESP's</acronym> require email marketers to perform regular list maintenance 
	and expire emails that have not been confirmed.  App-push does not have these restrictions, as long as the app is installed on the device it will be able to receive notifications (unless the device owner explicitly disallows notifications for the app).</li>

number of pricing schedules to customers. Based on the quantity of
products that are purchased, manufacturers can provide automated
discounts on unit pricing or shipping. Wholesalers can offer free shipping
or other promotions based on the qualifications set for each pricing
schedule. While additionally oper ating a B2C stor e, e-commerce
sites can offer completely different pricing, shipping and promotions for
purchases associated with each pricing schedule.

<h3>Affiliate/Intranet Sites</h3>

website with the same products and a shared inventory but different pricing.
The additional sites may have their own unique domain, or be hosted on any blog, forum, or Intranet which allows embedded HTMl and/or Javascript.  That means that resale customers can go directly to that site.
Intranet or B2B sites can be formatted in a quick order platform that's
easier to navigate for experienced B2B buyers. Payment methods, pricing
and shipping are easily set up so they're different from the retail store
and customized to each of the pricing schedules. The wholesale website
can be password protected and require a customer login. Alternatively, the
merchant can maintain one website, configuring it so when resale customers
log in, all pricing on the website changes to retail pricing.

	<h2>Supply Chain Automation</h2>

	<p>
	Improve the bottom line by eliminating manual processing and costly errors
CommerceRack’s Supply Chain Module provides unmatched technology that eliminates the need
for employees to manually place orders and download inventory/tracking updates.

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>

By facilitating automation and seamless data integrations, CommerceRack Supply Chain gives online businesses
the resources needed to save time, effort and money while reducing errors and improving product
selection. CommerceRack eliminates tedious manual processes, which lets you focus your time and energy
on increasing sales and growing your business.
</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Quicker, More Efficient</h3>
<p>

CommerceRack’s Supply Chain module eliminates the need for employees to manually place orders and
inventory updates. This not only decreases costs and saves time, it all but eliminates expensive
errors for online businesses that use in-house warehouses, fulfillment centers or drop-shippers.
Our unique technology tracks inventory, pricing and orders. It also automatically orders products
to be drop-shipped or restocks warehouses. Supply Chain also makes it easy and inexpensive
to try new products from multiple vendors without integration hassles. The broad selection and
prompt accurate delivery helps companies ensure outstanding customer service.

</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Seamless Order Placement</h3>
<p>

With CommerceRack Supply Chain, the merchant doesn’t have to re-enter customer order information to
place orders with suppliers. Supply Chain automatically transfers the information to the supplier,
and the system intuitively breaks down inbound orders for each supplier using the supplier’s
manufacturer SKU or product ID. This eliminates data entry errors.
</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Cost Savings</h3>
<p>
Supply Chain can send orders either individually or in bulk, facilitating better pricing with suppliers.
Many suppliers will not charge shipping or other fees if the retailer orders in bulk and reaches
either a specified price marker or a maximum number of days between orders. Supply Chain holds
the seller’s orders until a specified amount is reached, saving the merchant
money. With CommerceRack’s Just In Time (JIT) feature, orders are held for just three
days, which ensures prompt delivery.
</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>
CommerceRack Supply Chain allows online sellers to choose products from an
unlimited number of suppliers using different ordering and shipping
methods and locations. This technology can be used to integrate with any
combination of suppliers, fulfillment centers, call centers, drop-shippers
and even other CommerceRack stores. Supply Chain makes it easy to work with
multiple suppliers to provide shoppers with a single shipping estimate,
no matter how many suppliers are being used. Supply Chain automatically
selects shipping methods that get products to customers in the most
cost-effective manner.
</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Automatic Catalog and Pricing Updates</h3>
<p>
CommerceRack Supply Chain instantly recognizes cost changes and applies a simple
pricing markup formula, this means sellers don’t have to set prices for
each individual product. New products can be automatically imported,
and specific products that require special pricing can be overridden later
to have their own custom pricing. Pricing formulas can also be based on
variables such as vendor cost or MSRP.

<h3>Least Cost Routing</h3>
<p>
When there are multiple distributors for a single SKU then CommerceRack will use a weighted order item routing 
system to select the best supplier. It can look at proximity to customer, cost of item, grouping of items (on multi-item orders),
and several other tunable parameters.

<h3>Special Features to Make Ordering Easier</h3>
<ul>
<li> Stock: This method ships inventory to the seller’s warehouse. Supply Chain makes it possible to set minimum inventory levels and group customer orders into one bulk order to the supplier.</li>
<li> Fulfillment: Transmits new orders to a fulfillment center. Orders contain all product/cost information.</li>
<li> Drop Ship: Allows the supplier to ship the product directly to the customer. Order includes customer shipping details without pricing, and seller's contact information.</li>
<li> Manual: Supply Chain gives the option to manually place orders to a specific supplier.</li>
</ul>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>
Orders can be placed via e-mail, facsimile, XML or API. Supply Chain
also sends suppliers a request for confirmation of receipt and tracking
information which in turn is automatically sent to the customer.
</p>
</article>

<article data-trivia="more">
<h3>Integration Methods</h3>
<ul>
<li> Generic: The Generic Supplier format is designed for easy supplier integration.
This mode allows you to configure shipping rules for the supplier and
offers a variety of order transmission formats - facsimile, email, FTP,
and more. A URL is provided for suppliers to confirm orders and offer
tracking, which automatically updates your system and call centers and
also updates your customers. An open order report shows unconfirmed
orders. If available, the module can also import inventory and product
file locations. The generic format supports a variety of order export
formats, including plaintext, HTML, CSV and several XML flavors, so
you’re sure to find one that’s compatible with a supplier - regardless of
their back-end type.
</li>
<li> API Link: For more sophisticated suppliers who have their own B2B EDI/API interface,
CommerceRack provides a variety of tools to simplify integration and reduce
maintenance costs. The API method syncs with any B2B gateway interface
and any protocol, regardless of the destination system. It natively
exports many industry standard XML formats and easily converts data
to proprietary supplier interfaces using a small piece of middle-ware
that can be developed by CommerceRack's knowledgeable staff. Full documentation
is available for any integrator. Middleware uses XML over FTP or HTTP/S
REST, so it can be built in any language.
</li>
<li> Native Fulfillment Integrations
CommerceRack offers native API integrations into Fulfillment by Amazon, AtLast
Fullfillment and ShipWire. Several other warehouses have developed
interfaces for our API methods and are happy to provide estimates for
warehousing inventory in spaces from 10 square feet to more than
100,000 square feet.</li>

<article data-trivia="more">
	
To optimize the growth of their business, online
sellers must select the right technology
for their needs, and this technology must be
highly customizable, scalable and profitable.
CommerceRack’s Shipping Pro allows merchants to
completely modify shipping methods and
settings—a revolutionary tool even more
powerful than CommerceRack’s standard shipping
package.
Control your costs
• Use varying shipping calculations based on
different criteria (ship-to location, product,
subtotal of cart, etc.). Modify according to
distance and other costly factors.
• Offer handling or insurance as their own
line items in the shopping cart
• Assign different insurance values per
product
• Mark up FedEx or UPS rates with a
handling fee
• Mark up shipping costs for special or
hard-to-ship items
• Disable/enable certain shipping methods
for non-continental United States or APO/
FPO U.S. locations
• Block shipment to certain countries	

Give customers more options
• Offer delivery to local customers. This is a
great marketing tool for brick and mortar
businesses.. Word of mouth referrals are
priceless.
• Offer customer pickup. Again, brick and
mortar businesses stand to profit from this
option
• Offer insurance per item based on weight
or price
• Offer free shipping as a promotion.
When a high level, scalable solution is offered,
business is streamlined and empowered,
and is ready for growth. Since efficiency
saves time, cuts costs and improves accuracy,
sales are boosted. CommerceRack Shipping Pro’s
numerous built-in options save time and
protect the seller from hidden costs and
unforeseen logistical complications.
With CommerceRack Shipping Manager, you can
manage all the details of your shipping,
in one.

	<h2>Quickbooks Integration</h2>
<article data-trivia="more">

CommerceRack Order Manager provides simple, one-click QuickBooks integration that helps small and
medium-sized businesses increase sales without wasting time entering duplicate information.
Certified Gold Developer
CommerceRack is a QuickBooks Certified Gold Developer, which means our application is required to pass a
rigorous, third-party test each year as well as a detailed technical audit. This ensures that our software
is fine-tuned to provide seamless and accurate data transfer.
Everything Your Company Needs to Succeed
With CommerceRack, you get full-service order management. Many companies transmit only the basics to
QuickBooks, a “journal entry” summary with nothing more than bare bones sales data. No receipts.
No invoices. Nothing even closely resembling complete records. CommerceRack is different. Our customers
can immediately run all of the following:
▶▶ Profit-Loss reports
▶▶ Available inventory reports
▶▶ Sales by payment type (Visa, MasterCard, etc.)
▶▶ Sales by location (web vs. store)
▶▶ Sales by state
▶▶ Sales by item or category
▶▶ Daily bank reconciliation

Multiple Integration Options
Data transfer from CommerceRack to QuickBooks is automatic, but you call the
shots. A few simple clicks and you can get either a sales receipt or an
invoice, whichever suits your needs. Orders are set up to reflect accrual
sales or cash sales. Again, the choice is yours.
Easy Inventory Tracking
With CommerceRack, inventory is automatically updated in QuickBooks, so you can
see an accurate and up-to-the-minute accounting of what you have in your
store 24/7.
Information at Your Fingertips
All of the information to complete a sales receipt is transferred directly
from CommerceRack Order Manager into QuickBooks. It’s waiting for you when you
want it. The available information includes:
▶▶ Customer name (if desired)
▶▶ Who the product was shipped to
▶▶ Item number
▶▶ Sales price
▶▶ Where the product was sold (eBay, Amazon, etc.)
Direct Data Transfer
Unlike many competing order-management systems that use thirdparty
connectors, CommerceRack Order Manager/QuickBooks integrations are
imbedded in the CommerceRack platform so data is uploaded directly and you
get immediate notification the file was received. This is fast, prevents
duplicate orders and allows multiple users to log in simultaneously.
By contrast, the third-party connectors used by many CommerceRack competitors
aren’t QuickBooks Certified Gold Developers, so their integration generally
comes from an input file that only provides a one-way transmission.
That presents two problems: It’s prone to corruption and if there’s anything
wrong with the file, it’s extremely difficult to clean up or reverse.
Another advantage enjoyed by CommerceRack customers: The ability to stay in
QuickBooks as the order uploads rather than having to exit, which is what
you do if you’re using an order management platform from a company
that requires a QuickBooks administrator to do the upload.
For more information about CommerceRack and their products call a representative at 1.877.966.8948 www.CommerceRack.com
Handshake Transactions
CommerceRack takes pride in facilitating open communication between e-commerce
store owners and their customers. With CommerceRack the transfer of data to
QuickBooks allows each side to verify the status of an order. Store owners
don’t have to wonder if data is reaching customers or worry about creating
duplicate orders. The CommerceRack software does that for you. CommerceRack Order
Manager is also set up to create a purchase order automatically in Quick-
Books after the sale of any product that will be shipped by a third-party
fulfillment provider.
Simple Product Setup
Launching your QuickBooks integration is easy with CommerceRack. You choose
how you want to enter your products into QuickBooks, and then you
decide exactly how you want to manage them.
Choices include:
▶▶ Manual entry
▶▶ CSV file upload
▶▶ CommerceRack updating your products as you go

	<h2>Desktop Client</h2>
	Dramatically improve employee efficiency by giving them the right tools

	<article data-trivia="more">

	CommerceRack's unique order management system manages the order from the second it's placed to the
moment it's shipped. Once an order is created, or imported a copy is automatically downloaded
into the Order Manager so the fulfillment workflow can begin. Any changes, edits, or tracking that
are added to the order are automatically uploaded to the website and the customer is notified via
an email with no employee interaction. Best of all Order Manager is included FREE with most accounts.
Faster than a Web Browser
CommerceRack understands employee time is money. You'll never wait with a customer on hold for a page
to load with Order Manager. It uses a local database that keeps all employees working on the same
page, even if the Internet is slow or down, your operations and warehouse won't be. This makes
it ideal for phone orders or customer service counter point of sale. The system automatically
synchronizes all orders, inventory, products, customers and more, eliminating the need to manually
move data around.
Batch Order Processing
The ability to easily assign orders into batches for employee processing is a technique that is
considered to be the most efficient and scalable deployment of resources in an organization.
When combined with the advanced filtering feature it's easy to understand how much efficiency
this technique can bring to both customer service / warehouse operations.
Advanced Filtering
CommerceRack's advanced filtering makes it easy to identify and process batches of orders. For example
a common filter used during the holidays – could identify new orders, that are paid, with no fraud
hold, with one item, where the customer requested expedited shipping. Being able to quickly
identify orders, place those orders into batches to be picked and shipped and then monitor the
progress of the orders as they proceed through the workflow is just one reason people love the
Order Manager.

Site Specific Custom Packing Slips/Invoices
CommerceRack Order Manager can print out invoices or packing slips that are
different from each order. This makes it easy to operate multiple businesses
(domains) through a single warehouse and customer service organization.
For B2B companies it's incredibly easy to offer retailers the option of having
either blind or branded drop-shipping with the retailers logo, address, and
phone number.
Reduce Cost Through Automation
CommerceRack Order Manager saves merchants time and money by automating
the numerous time consuming tasks involved in processing orders.
Order Manager replaces the need for a number of employee roles.
Maintain employee accountability and productivity by tracking each
shipment to the staff member that handles the package. All actions are
recorded in an order event log. Control employee access using our role
based access control. Employee training mode is available for those
employees that make frequent errors. Ensure high valued products are
shipped correctly using an optional verification step to ensure there are
no errors.
For more information about CommerceRack and their products call a representative at 1.877.966.8948 www.CommerceRack.com
This document is intended as a summary of possible configuration options which may not be available in all scenarios.
Please refer to the online documentation for full product configuration details.

Shipping Made Easy
Shipping with UPS, FedEx, and USPS (via Endica) is fully integrated into
the CommerceRack Order Manager. Print packing slips, invoices or blind drop-ship
slips (with customer logos) in batches or individually. With just one click,
print shipping labels. Tracking numbers are then automatically saved
in Order Manager, and orders are tagged as “Complete” once shipped.
If necessary those tracking numbers are electronically transferred to
marketplaces such as eBay and Amazon without any employee interaction.
The CommerceRack Desktop Advantage
CommerceRack has always gone the extra mile for our clients to deliver a far
superior user experience and level of functionality. Ask any computer expert
and they'll tell you that a web-browser cannot match the functionality
or usability of a native desktop application when working with large
data-sets without sacrificing page load time. When dealing with data-sets
such as order processing, searching, and printing the Desktop Order
Manager lets employees get more done in less time, with dramatically
lower error rates which contribute directly to reduced overhead.

Targeted niche stores talk directly to different customer segments and generate sales

CommerceRack Stores allow e-businesses to create multiple stores which cater to specific customer
demographics. CommerceRack hosts an unlimited number of merchant domains. By highlighting different
products on different websites, sellers increase their chances of converting shoppers to buyers.
Options may also include varied pricing, shipping and promotional offers.
Each site has its own search engine ranking, which can be used to create niche sites that cater to
a specific type of buyer. Each store can have a different look and feel, category navigation, search
options. Product inventory, images, descriptions, and other details are shared across all sites,
making it easy for employees to add new products and update existing ones.
By using a single product database and inventory, CommerceRack users can create a new store in just a few
minutes. Sellers can create as many sites as they like. Most merchants use a shared shopping cart
so it’s easier to cross sell, market to customers, and manage sales information. CommerceRack multi stores
are ideal for e-businesses that sell a broad range of products or those that want to try out different
pricing strategies without affecting the sales of their primary site.
Target Multiple Audiences
Each specialty site can focus on a unique customer demographic with a specialized product listing
and unique appearance and navigation. E-businesses can increase the conversion of shoppers to
buyers by speaking directly to the needs of specific audiences.
SEO Targeted Sites
Specialty sites attract customers that are ready to buy the niche items they sell. Without any
extra cost CommerceRack users can boost their site rankings with audience targeted SEO product listings.
Individual sites can focus on a single product type or manufacturer. Your specialty site will rank
higher when potential customers do a web search for the sites SEO key word.

Wholesale Sites
CommerceRack makes it easy to use a unified product database and inventory,
so e-businesses can immediately start selling retail products to other
businesses with a separate wholesale website. The merchant has the
capability of offering varied pricing schedules and promotions based
on the number of items purchased, amount spent, etc. These wholesale
websites can be set up to have different payment methods and shipping
options than your retail store, and the site can also feature a quick-order
format to make re-ordering easy for repeat customers.
Online Shopping Mall Sites
Cross-selling is at its finest when you have an entire online shopping mall
of specialty stores. Customers can use one shared shopping cart and buy
from any of your stores with one quick, easy checkout.
Demographic Sites
The CommerceRack Order Manager advanced reporting features can easily track
the most profitable site designs, products or prices. E-businesses that
sell a wide range of unassociated products can sell select categories
of products on different specialty sites. All this while only maintaining
one inclusive product database. Sites share a shopping cart for cross
selling purposes. No matter which specialty site a customer purchases
from their data can be sent to one main database for marketing purposes.
Secret Sites
Promotional websites are a great way for e-businesses to entice shoppers.
You can offer incentives or discounts on items and shipping, all under a unique
domain. The promotional specialty site pulls from the same product list
and inventory as the main site, so maintenance is virtually effortless.
Diversify and Grow
The CommerceRack Order Manager advanced reporting feature easily tracks
the most profitable site designs, products or prices, in addition our
platform allows merchants to maintain a single inclusive product database
so e-businesses can efficiently sell a wide range of unassociated
products on different specialty sites.

it easier for customers to buy products from multiple sites.
Marketing can be sent to customers so they’re always aware of products
that may interest them, and with CommerceRack Newsletter functionality you
can easily communicate to specific demographics.

	<p class="indented">
	By 2011, most browsers on the market were releasing versions which could run the anyCommerce technology, and cloud services were rapidly growing in both popularity and stability.  Recognizing the size and scope of this opportunity led to a decision by CommerceRack's management team to spend six months focusing on a prototype which was completed in early 2012.
	</p>
	<p class="indented">
	After numerous unforeseen delays and failed light-bulb experiments, the decision to stop boarding new clients and focus all energies toward developing exclusively for the cloud was made as it proved to be the best way to pursue the company's long term revenue goals.  An end of life sunset date for SAAS hosted sites was announced and all resources were channelled into cloud products. The CommerceRack system was migrated to the new anyCommerce technology and the CommerceRack project was unveiled in Q1 of 2014.

						</h3>
						<p>At the center of your e-commerce universe is the DataFair which stores information in the cloud	for apps. 
						DataFairs have several advantages over databases:
						<ul>
							<li> 
							Improved Security: DataFairs use a single api + access control layer which is completely separated from the display logic.  This
	results in a significantly reduced threat profile. Since there is a single point of access control, the session management system using role based permissions is able to determine the
	regular 'usage' for a role and flag exceptions. Future versions will have the capability to throttle/pause suspicious behavior then alert security administrators
	via SMS or App-push.  For example when an admin user is accessing data records at a rate faster than their job role requires or on specially configured honey pot objects. 
	Either which could indicate a compromised account with admin priviledges.
							</li>
							<li> 
							Faster Access Times:  Intelligent Caching by the DataFair can determine frequently used data and make
							sure sstored in memory when requested.  In addition hot
							objects can be synchronized and cached locally on apps,
							saving bandwidth, and i/o.  This unique approach to
							caching significantly reduces costs in environments where these services are billable. 
							</li>
							<li> 
							Faster Development: a single interface to many services
							and data means it's easy to get more done in less time.
							</li>
						</ul>

						</p>					
						<p>
						Around the world designers, developers and testers are chomping at the bit to work on your apps. 
						We have standards and guides for them to go by. 
						Each application will start at the DESIGN stage, move to the DEVELOPMENT stage, and then proceed to the TESTING stage.

					<h2>Getting Started with CommerceRack</h2>
					<p class="indented">

The Cloud includes a lot of choices, in most cases if the right choice isn't immediately obvious, 
then it's probably safe to assume all the choices are approximately the same. 

					<ol>
					<li> 
					<b>Select Instance/License Type</b>: Public Cloud, Private Cloud, or SAAS. 
					<aside data-trivia="more">
				
When comparing offerings across providers it is important to understand the differences between DEDICATED, VIRTUALIZED, or MULTI-TENANT/SAAS instances.
<ul>
<li> DEDICATED instances have a committed input/output committed rate that will never be exceeded, or reduced, but resources are billed even when they are not in-use.
</li>
<li> 
VIRTUALIZED instances will have a committed input/output rate which will be lower, but also allow bursting when available and will be more affordable than dedicated resources, although bursting may not be available when it is necessary.
</li>
<li> MULTI-TENANT/SAAS (Software as a Service) is least expensive form because all resources are shared between tenants. SAAS is managed by one company, 
effectively acting as a 'property management' company for all the tenants.  
SAAS is a great way to save money for small companies, but configuration options are typically limited.
</li>
</ul>

Other considerations:
<ul>
<li> Dedicated, Virtualized, or SAAS can be deployed within public or private cloud. (In the case of SAAS the provider chooses the infrastructure)</li>
<li> Public Clouds offer a limited number of fixed configurations with varying memory, disk and performance configurations.</li>
<li> Public clouds are available from Amazon, Google, and other companies using OpenStack and can be either dedicated or virtualized.</li>
<li> Public clouds will always require companies to have their own independent primary care.</li>
<li> Private clouds allow companies to tweak the configurations of their own dedicated cloud instances, and frequently include some level of primary care with the service.</li>
<li> SAAS installations are deployed by Primary Care providers who will utilize either a public and private cloud infrastructure.  SAAS configurations are always bundled with support and infrastructure, because the infrastructure is the responsibility of the SAAS provider.  SAAS pricing is often transaction based, and is best suited for startup or companies who need an easy way to get started.</li>
<li> SAAS installations may also include specialized templates, or additional industry-specific capabilities or plugins that are not part of the general CommerceRack service and only available from that vendor.</li>
<li> WITH EITHER virtualized or dedicated instances the business has complete control about when and if upgrades to the software are performed.</li>
<li> As you might have expected choosing multi-tenant SAAS, virtualized or dedicated has an impact on support options for commerceRack.
SAAS provider will always provide their own CommerceRack Support.
</li>
<li>VIRTUALIZED or DEDICATED providers may provide their own support, or resell commercerack support.</li>
</ul>
					</aside>
					<aside data-trivia="dev">
					</aside>
					</li>
					<li> 
					<b>Select Instance+License</b>: The License Type will determine which infrastructure providers will be appropriate, and the costs.
					<aside data-trivia="more">
					
When purchased separately the licensing costs for commerceRack range are based on the size/cost of the instance.  
Developers who plan to offer SAAS deployments can obtain free licenses.
Software licensing does not include support, although some private/SAAS companies will offer their own support, 
which we recommend whenever it is available.
				
					</aside>
					<aside data-trivia="dev">
Required Services:
<ul>
<li> Instances, also called computing units which roughly translates to server capacity.</li>
<li> Network Disk Storage - which usually measured by performance and gigabytes</li>
<li> Bandwidth - which is usually measured by gigabytes transferred, and License Fees - which grant permission to run software on an instance, and will often vary based on instance size.</li>
</ul>

In addition there are optional services including:
<ul>
<li> Managed Database Hosting, Hot Object Cache, Dedicated IO Channels, and Content Distribution Networks.
optional services perform specific tasks much more efficiently and can further boost performance and usually reduce operating expenses.
<li> Now optional services don’t necessarily equate to higher costs or additional fees, quite to the contrary.
For example specialized cache services such as memcache or redis can dramatically boost performance on instances and can in some cases do the same work for less than (0.01%) point zero one percent of the price of doing the same work on a general instance.
</ul>

Identifying when these specialized services can be used, then deploying, tuning and monitoring these is the role of a service provider for the infrastructure.  
					</aside>
					</li>
					
					<li> 
					<b>Select a Service Provider</b>: Companies which lack in-house skills will want to retain one or more companies with technical expertise to assist in deployment, and ongoing maintenance. 
					<aside data-trivia="more">
For companies who select a cloud provider which does not offer support with infrastructure it must be purchased separately on either pre-paid or monthly basis. Technical support is not required, but is recommended for businesses who want to ensure their system is operating at peak efficiency. 					
					
Regardless of company size - the biggest expense of any cloud infrastructure will be the primary care provider who will act as a general contractor to BE ACCOUNTABLE for the overall health.
Primary care providers can be in-house technical staff, BUT ARE MORE commonly outside companies with personnel which are available to answer questions handle emergencies at all times.
A company's primary care provider will be responsible for a variety of tasks such as setup, monitoring, tear-down, backups, upgrades, and other general maintenance.  

CommerceRack support packages are available at a variety of price points ranging from free forum support, to several thousand dollars a month for committed service levels.  Self sign-up  options for non-SAAS configurations are available online or over the phone.

CommerceRack Support includes specialized know-how including:
backend diagnostics, configuration, and performance monitoring
application development/debugging assistance
marketplace specialists for eBay, Amazon, Rakutan, Newegg and others
and certifications to access the API’s for companies like eBay, Amazon, UPS, FedEx and others.

Primary care providers will frequently offer additional services such as graphic design, search engine marketing, or development, or provide referrals to other companies.
As with any type of project both fixed rate and hourly prices vary based on the types of service, length of service, and level of expertise involved.
For those on a budget services like elance, and odesk can provide competent offshore resources for as little as a few dollars per hour.  
But some companies may find managing those resources, along with difficulties communicating requirements and related delays may be more expensive and frustrating than hiring an experienced onshore firm.

					</aside>
					</li>
					
					<li> 
					<b>Deploy</b>: Install and configure the commerceRack software, run through the setup tutorial.					
					<aside data-trivia="more">
To keep operating costs low Public clouds do not have a sales force, and instead opt to provide a low cost or free tier for trying out their services. 

Because CommerceRack uses apps which will usually result in 1/10th the utilization of resources that a normal web application does -- a free tier is routinely sufficient for many small companies doing less than $1m in sales per year.  Now professional services costs are unfortunately not available at a ‘free tier’.  Very small companies doing under $1m in sales per year should will want to use a SAAS style commerceRack provider who will offer a managed multi-tenant configuration bundled with a variety of services, and pre-built application templates.   This is the best way to get the capabilities of CommerceRack at a price comparable to SAAS style offerings.
