First, we reduce costs by making data like product catalogs, inventory, crm, order and fulfillment, inventory, tracking and returns information available via the cloud.  We can synchronize with marketplaces like Amazon, eBay, directly with web browsers, and mobile devices, and also keep any legacy IT systems or websites in sync with all the sales you’re business is now generating.

CommerceRack is also app based.  Being app based means our technology is not only better optimized for mobile than traditional websites but it is also far more efficient and scalable because the app uses the customers phone, tablet, or browser to do the majority of the computing, it’s like each customer becomes part of your own giant cloud based supercomputer, instead of just consuming the resources of your computer.  The more customers you have running your apps, the more powerful your system becomes. 

CommerceRack has an offering for every major cloud infrastructure provider such as Amazon, Rackspace, Google.  But we also love to work with a variety of smaller private cloud infrastructure companies who can advise you and deliver the personalized services a growing company needs.  

There are also lots of other benefits of the app platform such as offering better security, integrated version control, reduced development times, increased API functionality and expandability that will make the nerds, err. I mean developers absolutely giddy.  Did we mention the app platform is entirely built in HTML5, CSS and Javascript -- that means every web developer on the planet already knows how to extend and customize it for your business. 

With CommerceRack it's easy, fast, and inexpensive for a business to:
* Create new interactive retail experiences for mobile, or in-store kiosks
* Migrate an existing website into the Cloud
* ** need to pull from business model canvas

CommerceRack works with leading infrastructure providers to provide world class support services, secure backups, elasticity, that are optimized for each infrastructures. 

CommerceRack provides mobile, and website app templates out of the box, in addition to offering automated integrations with leading marketplaces like Amazon and eBay.   You can use as much or as little as you want, there’s no hidden fees or special prices. 

For companies who already have software with other m-commerce, e-commerce platforms, erp or crm software -- it can either replace, or integrate with those existing systems.  

The only costs you have are the infrastructure costs your business consumes, which on the cloud will typically be around 1/10th the conventional operating costs of a website. 

CommerceRack work with existing infrastructure, while delivering new app based functionality that offers customers more functionality and saves costs by moving data into the cloud, and computing on the customers device.


connecting all commerce to the cloud
				
				
				
				
All commerce platforms today were designed for a pre-iphone internet. Website designs have changed, but server architectures haven’t. 
Designed to run in a cloud infrastructure such as Amazon EC2, Openstack or other private cloud offerings. 
Provides significant infrastructure cost savings and increased performance by offering edge caching, hot object caching, intelligent session based cache management, static content, and optimized payloads (which often fit within a single TCP/IP packet unlike normal webpages which must be fragmented and reassembled). 
1:1 feature parity with AnyCommerce: CommerceRack UI is built using AnyCommerce development framework (makes it easy to extend/customize for synching backend/front-end operations)
Marketplace support: Amazon, eBay, Buy.com, Google, etc. 
Supports price monitoring and auto-repricing on both website, mobile *AND* RETAIL. 
Advanced logistics support for Fulfilled by Amazon, and multiple warehouse /ship from closest/ to client. 
Required for many of the advanced features of anyCommerce
ex: CRM module supports device APNS/GCM identifiers for app push
auto-monitoring and matching Amazon price within seconds
Can offer bi-directional communication using websockets, and deliver content using the blazing fast SPDY protocol (the replacement for HTTP:// designed by Google)
Offers simplified/reliable integration synchronous/asynchronous business event propagation (pub/sub model) ex: ORDER.CREATED, ORDER.SHIPPED, CUSTOMER.NEW can be used to securely notify a variety of other specialized software and custom scripts, implement advanced loyalty programs, supplier chain notifications, business intelligence, and more.   No need to install vendor code/plugins into the backend which accidentally could compromise  security or stability. 

Every other existing commerce platforms require individual IOS/Android native clients resulting in excessive costs, unnecessary headaches, and a total disregard for a unified experience across platforms.   
In a typical e-business the following technologies are needed:
Web Backend (ASP, PHP, Perl, Java, ColdFusion, etc.)
Web Frontend (Javascript, HTML5, CSS3)
Apple/IOS Mobile: Objective C
Android:  Java + Android SDK
With CommerceRack and the open source anyCommerce framework it's much simplier.
Just cloud hosting, HTML5, CSS, Javascript, and a few small optional native shells.
Deploy one app that can run on desktop browsers like firefox, chome, safari, and ie, and also offer native google play, apple app store, and windows 8 downloads. 
CommerceRack can communicates bi-directionally using websockets, and delivers content using the blazing fast SPDY protocol (the replacement for HTTP:// which was designed by Google)
CommerceRack can provides significant infrastructure cost savings and increased performance by facilitating edge content distribution, hot object caching, intelligent session based cache management, static content, and highly efficient use of ephemeral storage and on-demand elastic computing. 
CommerceRack offers developers simplified/reliable integration via synchronous/asynchronous business event propagation ex: ORDER.CREATED, ORDER.SHIPPED, CUSTOMER.NEW which can be used to securely notify a variety of other specialized software and custom scripts, implement advanced loyalty programs, supplier chain notifications, business intelligence, and more.   No need to install vendor code/plugins into the backend which could inadvertently compromise  security or stability.
Speaking of security - because CommerceRack apps run locally on a persons computer -- many of the traditional attack vectors are no longer available to the bad guys. Quite to the contrary - each computer running an app acts as it’s own standalone node in the cloud infrastructure, it cannot access other nodes - it means the most common types of attacks would actually target the attackers own computer.

The problem: All mobile platforms today are bolt-ons to existing legacy technology developed for a pre-mobile Internet.   All other existing commerce platforms deliver IOS/Android native clients resulting in lack of unified experience across platforms.   Today to deploy a web+mobile strategy for a company the following technologies are needed:
Web Backend (ASP, PHP, Perl, Java, ColdFusion, etc.)
Web Fronted (Javascript, HTML5, CSS3)
Apple/IOS Mobile: Objective C
Android:  Java + Android SDK 
AnyCommerce is the only platform which simplifies development of retail applications so the web backend+frontend/Apple IOS Mobile/Android can all be built by one person/team using the same with HTML5, CSS3, Javascript.
AnyCommerce is designed for business who need to deliver mobile optimized capabilities, while still offering compatibility with existing legacy browser based systems.  Examples of mobile optimized capabilities for retailers:: 
Offer New forms of engagement (Ex: non-consumption based rewards)
Better customer communication via push messaging (skips spam filters), geofencing alerts, one time use, replaces antiquated email coupons.
Accessible Voice driven interfaces (via native shells) for mobile  (Google Now, Google Glass, Siri)
Compatible with NFC “bump” technology for queuing / reservations, supports showing customer their “place in line”, reminders for appointments, etc. 
Connect to customer links app with backend, good for video chat, customer assistance, etc. in any sort of high touch. 
Let customers engage other clients on wifi in trivia, games of chance, ex: structured twitter in a business.   Structure/Facilitate sharing via social media by incorporating technology as part of the purchasing process. 
Give consumers the power to control/suggest music, televisions, etc.
Simplify repeat business using QR codes on receipts, call center pops with order history, etc. ? because it’s all on the cloud!
A commerce platform built in pure HTML5, CSS3, JS
No PHP, Java, Coldfusion, etc.  ? any webdeveloper can use it!
Native platform support for Android, IOS, Windows8(XBox), and ChromeOS
Works on everything.
Hyper Efficient / Green  (Cost Savings)
Based on real world conditions consumes roughly 20% the backend resources of a conventional e-com website, while providing a better user experience. 
Uses less radio/bandwidth = better power and lower usage bills!
Multiple ways to use/deploy
Speaks all popular protocols (CSV / XML / JSON / FTP / EDI / REST), is compatible with everything. 
AnyCommerce makes testing/deploying easy by being able to run/test on the developers local machine or on an iphone/ipad/android phone/tablet using a proxy. This improves productivity of developers and decreases time to market.  
AnyCommerce is built on GIT the largest open source distributed authoring system, already known by 3 million developers it provides tracking and accountability by each contributor to a project making it easy for designers, developers, integrations, testers, to create something amazing.  Git is used to build well known distributed open-source projects like Linux.
